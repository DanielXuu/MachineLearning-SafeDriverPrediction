# Safe-Driver-Prediction

ABSTRACT

Classification problems are popular topics in machine learning field, which combines solutions of various models used. Although models including logistic regression, support vector machines and others are common for classification, model selection is vital when dealing with different datasets. Our studies contain the process of data pre-processing, feature selection, dataset normalization, model evaluation to find out the best model fitted. The challenge of the studies is implementing appropriate machine learning approaches to solve the real-world problem of predicting the whether the driver will generate a claim in the next year for insurance company. The result is illustrated by the performance evaluation using accuracy, precision and recall of multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Network, LDA, QDA, K-nearest-neighbor, Random Forests and AdaBoosting.
